# Propolis git mirror #

Propolis is a TRIPS system customized for parsing paragraphs from the [ProPara dataset](https://allenai.org/data/propara).

This git repo is a mirror of the TRIPS `propolis` CVS module.

Note that the `src/config/lisp/defsystem/defsystem-3.6i/` directory contains a modified, non-standard, non-official version of [MK:DEFSYSTEM](http://www.cliki.net/mk-defsystem) 3.6i. See the comments near the top of `defsystem.lisp` in that directory for its copyright notice and license.
